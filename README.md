# End-to-End ML Pipeline Project

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline, from raw data ingestion to model deployment.  
It demonstrates best practices in modular design, reproducibility, and production readiness.

Key highlights:
- Automated data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple model training and evaluation
- Logging and monitoring for transparency

## ⚙️ Pipeline Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Load raw datasets (CSV/SQL/JSON)
   - Handle missing values and imbalanced classes

2. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Scaling, encoding, and transformation
   - Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

3. **Model Training**
   - Benchmarked classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost, AdaBoost, Decision Tree
   - Hyperparameter tuning with grid/random search

4. **Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix, ROC curves, precision/recall, F1-score
   - Feature importance visualization
